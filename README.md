Contains the thesis which created this respository. The ultimate goal is to understand the water quality using a wealth of data that already exists using a GIS.

This GitHub account was created for a USC GIS masters' thesis by Don Borer with Dr. Karen Kemp as the advisor. The thesis in this repository 'Borer_Thesis_FINAL.doc' is the approved draft sent to the USC thesis center and awaits their review (as of Sept 7, 2018). I will update the document when there are changes.

The Esri project is available at https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0cd5f60513f3453cbae592b4ff99f9a5.

I am avialable for assistance and consultation at donborer@hotmail.com or 310-567-3370. Dr. Kemp is available at kakemp@usc.edu.
